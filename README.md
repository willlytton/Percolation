# Percolation

Coursera's and Princetons and Data Structures and Algorithms week 1 assignment 

Percolation is the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter till it reaches the bottom and begins to pour. In this princeton DSA project. I was instructed to use the union find algorithm to make a grid of n size and and assigned grid coordinates. At random grid coordinates are selected and opened and would connect in a stream. Once enough opened the system would percolate allowing simulated liquid to pass through till it reached the bottom of the grid.
